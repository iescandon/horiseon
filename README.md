# Bootcamp: Horiseon Website Refactor


# Live Site
https://iescandon.github.io/horiseon/


## Description 

The Horiseon website is designed to promote its business. Horiseon's business is to help other businesses improve their online presence. Horiseon offers services such as Search Engine Optimization, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing all while increasing brand awareness and decreasing work and expenditures. 

The website is designed mostly to be informative. Bright pictures are meant to attract viewers. Large headers and concise texts are meant to present the information simple and effectively. To add some interactivity, links on the nav bar can be clicked on to be directed towards the specific section. CSS is bright and colorful and easy to read. Additionally alt tags have been added to allow this website to be accesible to all.

In the future I would like to fix some of the overflow issues that happen when minimizing the screen within the main sections and the nav bar. I had challenges with that and hope to be able to overcome them. Additionally, in order to make this website more succesful for Horiseon, I think it would be important to include contact info within the same index.html or a different page.

## Credits

I worked with McRae Peavy on the semantic HTML. We also tried to fix the issue with overflow and floating, but we were unable to resolve the issue just yet.
